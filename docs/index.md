## Quick Example

```typescript
// Define a model
interface UserAttributes {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  created_at?: Date;
  // Relationship attributes
  posts?: Post[]
}

class User extends Model<UserAttributes> {
  protected static table = 'users';
  protected static fillable = ['name', 'email'];
  
  // Define relationships
  postsRelation(): HasMany<User, Post> {
    return this.hasMany(Post, 'user_id', 'id');
  }
}

// Use the model
const user = await User.create({
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@example.com'
});

const posts = await user.postsRelation().where('published', true).get();
```
